    Variations of the one line tree (cite: github gist #2012250) have
    been discussed at length on gitHub and the whole of the Internet.
    In them, Tree() is a pseudo-constructor function that returns a
    defaultdict [from collections] whose members are trees. Merely
    referencing a node brings it into being, no matter how deep it is.

    For those who are unfamiliar with the defaultdict, it is just a dict
    that *may* not throw a KeyError when an attempt is made to retrieve
    a value from a key that does not (yet) exist. This defaultdict just
    says "I'll create one for you," although you may create defaultdict-s
    that behave as badly as desired.

    But what about the value associated with this phantom key? The value
    is supplied by a function object passed to default dict that is
    used to create the value. It can be anything that is callable. The
    UR version is based on the extension found in (cite: github gist
    #4451005).

    The only exception is the NotImplemented singleton, raised if you
    attempt to graft a Tree to something that is a non-Tree.
